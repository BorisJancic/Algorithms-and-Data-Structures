# Projects for ECE 250, Algorithms and Data Structures


## Project 1: Calculator App
Simple calculator using object oriented patterns

## Project 2: Virtual Page Translation
Translation of virtual to physical pages based on PID using a hash table  
Hash table can be intantiated to use either chaining or open addressing  

## Project 3: Spellcheck
Implementation of a simple spellchecker using a trie data structure  

## Project 4: Electrical Grid Cost Analysis
Computes the minimum cost of building an electrical grid by computing the weight of a minimum spanning tree  
Minimum spanning tree is computed using Prim's algorithm
